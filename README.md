# Route Cipher Program

This program implements the **Route Cipher**, an encryption and decryption method where a message is written into a grid and then read in a spiral order. The program allows the user to choose between encryption and decryption, input their message, and provide a secret key (column size).

## Features

- **Route Cipher**: Encrypts and decrypts messages by writing them in a grid (matrix) and reading the grid in a spiral order.
- **Secret Key**: The secret key is the number of columns used to create the grid. The program will prompt for the secret key during encryption and decryption.
